- two month decision point, gives the candidate an opportunity to start looking for another job
- treat the program like a product
  - iterate
  - put up a landing page that feeds into a trello board or some such.
  - say no to everyone at first, establish who is out there
- make sure candidates get the same experience they'd get on the job
- make sure apprenticeship candidates go through the same interview process as every other candidate
- more than one participant at a time: provides community
- allow candidate to set up their own success criteria
- any learning the candidate does should be shared back with the mentor
  - tell me
  - show me
- Be very clear about it being an apprenticeship
  - candidates are willing to take a step back to learn
  - only take candidates excited about the apprenticeship opportunity. focus on people who want to learn/grow
- Find a way to evaluate where the candidate is starting from
  - understand where they are now 
  - give them a challenge that can be used to guage their learning speed
- when it was more of a bootcamp, 30% success rate
- when it was more of a feeder program, 85% success rate
- encourage candidates to network, go to meet ups, etc 
  - your network is how you find jobs, thrive
